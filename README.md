# Glitch Garden :sunflower: :japanese_ogre: :video_game:

### Context
Game developed while following the "Complete C# Unity Developer" online course. I took the lectures as a basis to create something to my own liking and this was the result.

### Description
Game similar to Plants vs Zombies, where you must place 'defenders' :sunflower: to fight incoming enemies :japanese_ogre:

The objective is to survive the longest you can.

The game was targeted for Android :iphone:
But in this repository there is a version available for Windows.
